    <action>Review git vs story File List discrepancies:
      1. **Files changed but not in story File List** → MEDIUM finding (incomplete documentation)
      2. **Story lists files but no git changes** → HIGH finding (false claims)

    </action>

    <!-- Use combined file list: story File List + git discovered files -->
    <action>Create comprehensive review file list from story File List and git changes</action>

    <!-- AC Validation -->
    <action>For EACH Acceptance Criterion:
      1. Read the AC requirement
      2. Search implementation files for evidence
      3. Determine: IMPLEMENTED, PARTIAL, or MISSING
      4. If MISSING/PARTIAL → HIGH SEVERITY finding
    </action>

    <!-- Task Completion Audit -->
    <action>For EACH task marked [x]:
      1. Read the task description
      2. Search files for evidence it was actually done
      3. **CRITICAL**: If marked [x] but NOT DONE → CRITICAL finding
      4. Record specific proof (file:line)
    </action>

    <!-- Documentation Impact Verification (Enhanced — Story 25.4) -->
    <!-- Step A: Classify changed files using the decision tree -->
    <action>Classify EACH file in the comprehensive review list into user-facing or internal:

      USER-FACING file patterns (require docs verification):
        1. src/docvet/cli.py or CLI flag changes → expects docs/site/cli-reference.md
        2. src/docvet/config.py or [tool.docvet] key changes → expects docs/site/configuration.md
        3. src/docvet/checks/*.py (check behavior changes) → expects docs/site/checks/{check_name}.md
        4. Rule behavior changes → expects docs/site/rules/{rule_name}.md
        5. Public API surface changes (__all__, new modules) → expects reference/ updates (auto-generated from docstrings)
        6. User workflow changes (install, pre-commit, CI setup) → expects README.md and/or relevant docs/site/ page

      INTERNAL file patterns (NO docs required):
        - tests/**
        - .github/** (CI config, instructions, templates)
        - _bmad/** and _bmad-output/**
        - .claude/** and other IDE config (.cursor/, .windsurf/)
        - pyproject.toml (UNLESS config key changes in [tool.docvet])
        - Internal refactoring with no behavior change

      Collect the set of EXPECTED docs pages based on which user-facing patterns matched.
    </action>

    <!-- Step B: Read the story's Documentation Impact section -->
    <action>Extract the story's Dev Notes → Documentation Impact section:
      - Read the "Pages:" field (concrete page paths or "None — no user-facing changes")
      - Read the "Nature of update:" field
    </action>

    <!-- Step C: Cross-reference and produce findings -->
    <action>Compare file classification results against story's Documentation Impact:

      CASE 1 — Documentation Impact section is missing or empty:
        → MEDIUM finding: "Documentation Impact section missing — every story must declare affected pages or 'None'"

      CASE 2 — Story says "None" but changed files include user-facing source code:
        → HIGH finding: "Documentation Impact says 'None' but PR modifies user-facing files: {list files}. Expected docs updates: {expected pages from decision tree}"

      CASE 3 — Story lists specific pages but those pages are NOT in the File List (not actually updated):
        → HIGH finding: "Documentation Impact lists {pages} but these were not updated in the PR. Either update the docs or explain why in a completion note"

      CASE 4 — Story lists pages AND those pages appear in the File List:
        → No finding (docs were planned and delivered)

      CASE 5 — Story says "None" AND all changed files are internal (tests, CI, BMAD, config):
        → No finding (correctly classified as no user-facing impact)

      CASE 6 — File classification identifies expected docs pages NOT listed in Documentation Impact:
        → MEDIUM finding: "Changed files suggest docs updates to {expected pages} but Documentation Impact doesn't list them"
    </action>

    <!-- Code Quality Deep Dive -->
    <action>For EACH file in comprehensive review list:
      1. **Security**: Look for injection risks, missing validation, auth issues
      2. **Performance**: N+1 queries, inefficient loops, missing caching
      3. **Error Handling**: Missing try/catch, poor error messages
      4. **Code Quality**: Complex functions, magic numbers, poor naming
      5. **Test Quality**: Are tests real assertions or placeholders?
    </action>

    <!-- SonarQube Analysis (if MCP server available) -->
    <action>For EACH modified src/ file in the comprehensive review list:
      1. Read the file content
      2. Run analyze_code_snippet MCP tool with projectKey "docvet" and language "py"
      3. Report any HIGH or BLOCKER severity findings as review issues
      4. Note cognitive complexity warnings (threshold: 15) as MEDIUM findings
      5. If SonarQube server is unreachable (off-LAN), skip gracefully and note in review
