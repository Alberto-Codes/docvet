### Stories

| Story | Title | Type | Debug Sessions | Review Findings |

| 25.3 | Enforce docs updates in story creation | BMAD workflow | 0 | 3M, 2L — 4 fixed, 1 accepted |
| 25.4 | Add docs-impact check to code review | BMAD workflow | 0 | 1M, 2L — all fixed |
| 25.5 | Investigate CI docs-freshness check | Spike | 0 | N/A (spike, no code review) |

## Successes

- **Two-gate docs-enforcement system established** — Stories 25.3 (create-story gate) and 25.4 (code-review check) close the longest-carried retro action item chain in the project (originating from Epic 22)
- **Evidence-based spike with courage to defer** — Story 25.5 conducted comprehensive ecosystem research (mkdocs plugins, commercial tools, academic research) and analyzed 12 historical PRs before recommending "defer CI automation" — process gates are sufficient for current scale
- **Decision documentation as first-class deliverable** — Story 25.2's 5-decision-point table with resolution and rationale established a pattern for config stories
- **Code reviews catching real issues on non-code stories** — 15 findings across 4 reviewed stories, including 2 HIGH findings in 25.2 where deferred verification tasks were incorrectly marked done
- **Zero-debug streak continues** — 16+ consecutive stories across Epics 22-25

---

## Challenges

- **Entire epic was process/convention** — no new Python runtime code, no new tests, no feature work; test count unchanged at 971. Hard to show stakeholder value.
- **Deferred AC pattern (25.2)** — ACs 3 and 4 required post-merge verification; addressed with Post-Merge Maintainer Actions checklist but remains a manual tracking mechanism
- **Pre-existing gaps surfaced but backlogged** — Code review of 25.1 found CLAUDE.md stale test structure (M2) and `test_exports.py` missing `docvet.lsp` (L1); correctly scoped as separate chores but highlights accumulation of small gaps

---

## Key Insights

1. **Process infrastructure epics pay dividends in subsequent epics** — the two-gate docs-enforcement system resolves a four-retro-old action item chain; value will be measured starting with Epic 26
2. **Evidence-based decision-making is more valuable than building for building's sake** — Story 25.5's "defer" recommendation backed by data was the right call, avoiding unnecessary CI complexity
3. **Non-code stories need full review rigor** — 15 findings across 4 stories proves that config, workflow, and convention changes contain real quality issues
4. **Long-carried retro items do eventually resolve** — the retrospective system works, even if some items take multiple epics to close

## Previous Retro Follow-Through (Epic 24)

| # | Action Item | Status |
|---|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Spec quality with exact external API signatures | N/A — no external library integrations in this epic |
| 2 | Ecosystem research before design deviations | Applied — Story 25.5 spike conducted comprehensive research before "defer" recommendation |
| 3 | Tests must exercise real code paths, not reimplement logic | N/A — no new Python tests in this epic |

**Applicable action items completed: 1/1** (2 not applicable due to epic nature)

**Carried Forward from Epic 22 (final status):**

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Enforce docs-site updates in DoD → Story 25-3 | **Done** |
| Add docs-impact check to code review → Story 25-4 | **Done** |
| Investigate CI docs freshness check → Story 25-5 | **Done** (spike: recommend defer) |
| Explore diagrams-as-code → Story 26-3 | Backlog (Epic 26) |

**Follow-through trend:** `4/4 → 2/4 → 1/4 → 3/3 → 3/3 → 3/3 → 3/3 → 4/6 → 7/8 → 2/2 → 0/2 → 0/1 → 2/4 → 2/2 → N/A → N/A → N/A → N/A → 3/3 → 3/3 → 3/3 → 1/1`

## Action Items

### Process Improvements

1. **Validate docs-enforcement gates on first real epic**
   - Owner: Bob (SM)
   - Success criteria: During Epic 26 story creation and code review, verify that the 25.3 create-story gate and 25.4 code-review check fire correctly and produce appropriate findings/acknowledgments

2. **Maintain decision documentation pattern for config stories**
   - Owner: All devs
   - Success criteria: Any future config/CI story includes explicit decision points with resolution and rationale (following 25.2's 5-decision-point table pattern)

### Technical Debt

None new. Epic 25 shipped clean.

### Carried Forward

- CLAUDE.md stale test structure section → backlog chore (from 25.1 review M2)
- `test_exports.py` missing `docvet.lsp` module → backlog chore (from 25.1 review L1)
- Editor integration docs page → Story 26-2 (Epic 26)
- Explore diagrams-as-code → Story 26-3 (Epic 26)

### Team Agreements

- Process/convention epics are valid investments — don't apologize for them, measure their dividends
- Non-code stories get full adversarial code review (proven again: 15 findings across 4 stories)
- Deferred ACs require explicit tracking mechanism (Post-Merge Maintainer Actions checklist pattern from 25.2)

---

## Readiness Assessment

- Testing & Quality: All green, 971 tests passing, zero docvet findings
- Deployment: N/A — no new runtime code to deploy
- Stakeholder Acceptance: N/A — process infrastructure epic
- Technical Health: Stable, zero concerns
- Unresolved Blockers: None

## Next Steps

1. Begin Epic 26 — no prep sprint needed
2. Story 26.1 (CONTRIBUTING.md) is trivial, good warmup
3. Story 26.2 (editor integration page) validates the docs-enforcement gates from 25.3/25.4
4. Review action items in next standup
