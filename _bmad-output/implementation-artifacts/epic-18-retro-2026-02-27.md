# Retrospective: Epic 18 — Documentation Site Navigation

**Date:** 2026-02-27
**Facilitator:** Bob (Scrum Master)
**Epic:** Epic 18 — Documentation Site Navigation
**Status:** Complete (1/1 stories done)

## Team Participants

- Bob (Scrum Master) — Facilitator
- Alice (Product Owner)
- Charlie (Senior Dev / Architect)
- Dana (QA Engineer)
- Elena (Junior Dev)
- Alberto-Codes (Project Lead)

## Epic Summary & Metrics

**Delivery:**

- Stories completed: 1/1 (100%)
- FRs completed: FR3, FR4
- NFRs satisfied: NFR3
- Files modified: `docs/main.py` (27 insertions / 4 deletions)
- Zero source code changes — docs-only epic

**Quality:**

- Debug sessions required: 0 (15th consecutive zero-debug epic)
- Blockers encountered: 0
- Technical debt incurred: 0 new items
- Regressions: 0
- Quality gates: 7/7 green (762 tests passing)
- Code review: Approved with fixes (2 MEDIUM fixed, 1 LOW fixed, 3 LOW accepted)

**Agent Models Used:**

- Story 18.1: Claude Opus 4.6

## Successes & Strengths

1. **DRY architecture payoff.** One macro change in `rule_header()`, all 19 rule pages updated automatically. Zero per-page edits. Built on existing `rules.yml` + macro infrastructure from earlier epics.
2. **Thorough Dev Notes with guardrails.** The "What NOT to Change" section explicitly prevented scope creep — no individual rule page edits, no new `rules.yml` fields, no new plugins.
3. **Healthy code review.** Found real issues: redundant f-string, understated File List scope, misleading AC-to-Test mapping. All actionable findings fixed.
4. **Clean single-session execution.** Single-file change, zero debug sessions, all 7 gates green on first pass.
5. **Compounding returns on architecture.** The `rules.yml` data file and `rule_header()` macro were investments from earlier epics. Epic 18 added one line of output and got back-links on 19 pages — that's leverage.

## Challenges & Growth Areas

1. **No automated regression tests for mkdocs macro output.** AC verification was manual (`mkdocs build --strict` + grep). No test harness for mkdocs macros exists. If someone removes the back-link line, the build still passes — the link just disappears silently.
2. **Scope description drift in story artifacts.** File List initially understated scope because docstring enrichment (to satisfy `docvet check --all`) inflated the diff beyond the feature change. Recurring pattern from Epic 17.

## Key Insights & Learnings

1. **DRY investments compound.** Previous macro infrastructure made this epic trivial. One function change, 19 pages updated with zero per-page maintenance burden.
2. **"What NOT to Change" sections prevent scope creep.** Explicitly listing what should NOT be modified is as valuable as listing what should. Carry this practice forward.
3. **Small, well-scoped single-story epics execute predictably.** When building on existing infrastructure, near-zero friction is achievable. Two consecutive zero-friction epics (17, 18) confirm the pattern.
4. **Manual verification works but accumulates untested surface area.** Docs tooling (macros, build hooks) lacks automated regression tests. Acceptable for now, but worth revisiting if macro complexity grows.

## Previous Retro Follow-Through

**Epic 17 Action Items:**

No action items were set in Epic 17's retrospective. Clean slate.

**Trend: 4/4 → 2/4 → 1/4 → 3/3 → 3/3 → 3/3 → 3/3 → 4/6 → 7/8 → 2/2 → 0/2 → 0/1 → 2/4 → 2/2 → N/A → N/A**

**Analysis:** Two consecutive N/As reflect two small, clean epics (CI-only and docs-only) that generated no action items. The trend is meaningful only across meatier epics.

## Technical Debt

No new technical debt incurred in Epic 18. No carried items remaining.

## Action Items

None. Epic was clean, no process changes needed.

## Team Agreements

1. **Continue "What NOT to Change" pattern in Dev Notes.** Explicitly listing what should not be modified prevented scope creep in Epic 18 and should be standard practice for future stories.

## Next Epic Preview

**Epic 19: Advanced Exclude Patterns** (2 stories)

- Story 19-1: Trailing-slash and double-star pattern support
- Story 19-2: Integration tests and documentation
- Dependencies on Epic 18: None
- Preparation needed: None — team is ready to start immediately
- Key technical approach: `pathlib.PurePath.full_match()` for `**` glob support (Python 3.12+)

## Readiness Assessment

- Testing & Quality: All 7/7 gates green, 762 tests passing, zero regressions
- Deployment: Docs site live with back-links at alberto-codes.github.io/docvet
- Stakeholder Acceptance: Confirmed by Alberto-Codes
- Technical Health: Rock solid, single-file change with zero side effects
- Unresolved Blockers: None

**Verdict:** Epic 18 fully complete. All 19 rule pages now show breadcrumb back-links to their parent check page. No dependencies or blockers for Epic 19.
