- Alice (Product Owner)
- Charlie (Senior Dev / Architect)
- Dana (QA Engineer)
- Elena (Junior Dev)
- Alberto-Codes (Project Lead)

## Epic Summary & Metrics

**Delivery:**

- Stories completed: 2/2 (100%)
- Test suite: 746 → 762 (16 net new tests: 9 unit + 8 integration, minus 1 overlap)
- Files modified: `config.py`, `test_config.py`, `test_discovery.py`, `configuration.md`
- Python source code changes: Only `config.py` (3 touch points: valid keys, validation, merge)
- FRs completed: FR1–FR7 (7 FRs)
- NFRs satisfied: NFR1–NFR5 (5 NFRs)
- Review findings: 3 total on Story 16.1 (2 MEDIUM fixed, 1 LOW dropped)

**Quality:**

- Debug sessions required: 0 (13th consecutive zero-debug epic)
- Blockers encountered: 0
- Technical debt incurred: 0 new items
- Regressions: 0
- Quality gates: 13/13 green (6 gates on 16.1 + 7 gates on 16.2)

**Agent Models Used:**

- Stories 16.1–16.2: Claude Opus 4.6

## Successes & Strengths

1. **Perfectly scoped 2-story epic, delivered in one day.** Config parsing + merge logic in 16.1, integration verification + docs in 16.2. No scope surprises, no rework.
2. **Clean separation of concerns.** `extend-exclude` is a TOML-only directive merged into `exclude` at config load time. No new `DocvetConfig` field, zero changes to `discovery.py`. Downstream consumers have zero awareness of the feature (NFR3).
3. **Peer convention research eliminated all design decisions.** The epic spec documented ruff, black, and flake8's `extend-exclude` merge formula: `final = (user_exclude or defaults) + extend_exclude`. One correct answer, no debate needed.
4. **Strong test pyramid.** 9 unit tests (7 AC + 2 edge cases from code review) covering merge logic, plus 8 integration tests covering DIFF/ALL/STAGED modes and fnmatch pattern types.
5. **13th consecutive zero-debug epic.** The validation pattern was copied from the existing `exclude` block, and the merge formula was well-specified. No trial-and-error.
6. **All previous retro action items resolved (2/2).** Both Epic 15 items — create-story workflow retro surfacing and sprint-status "done" definition — were implemented inline with the Epic 15 retro commit. Broke a four-retro carry-forward chain on action item #1.

## Challenges & Growth Areas

1. **Story 16.2 code review not documented.** The review was performed but the story file's Code Review section was left empty (no reviewer, no findings, verification checkboxes unchecked). Process gap in record-keeping, not in actual quality assurance.

## Key Insights & Learnings

1. **Peer convention research as spec input is a design-decision eliminator.** When three major tools (ruff, black, flake8) use the same pattern, there's no design discussion needed — just follow the convention.
2. **Additive features on a mature architecture execute nearly friction-free.** Epic 16 added a config key with no behavioral changes to existing code. The architecture supported it cleanly because config loading and file discovery are well-separated.
3. **Implementing retro action items inline with the retro commit is effective.** Both Epic 15 action items were shipped in the same commit as the retro document, ensuring they don't linger.

## Previous Retro Follow-Through

**Epic 15 Action Items:**

| # | Action | Status | Evidence |
|---|--------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Add retro action item surfacing to create-story workflow | ✅ Completed | Step 1b added to `create-story/instructions.xml` in commit `08d4816` |
| 2 | Codify "done = all ACs verified" in sprint-status definitions | ✅ Completed | Sprint-status STATUS DEFINITIONS updated in commit `08d4816` |

**Score: 2/2 completed**

**Trend: 4/4 → 2/4 → 1/4 → 3/3 → 3/3 → 3/3 → 3/3 → 4/6 → 7/8 → 2/2 → 0/2 → 0/1 → 2/4 → 2/2**

## Technical Debt

No new technical debt incurred in Epic 16. No carried items — clean slate.

## Action Items

| # | Action | Owner | Priority | Success Criteria |
|---|--------|-------|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | Backfill Story 16.2 code review section | Alberto-Codes | LOW | Review section has reviewer, outcome, and verification checkboxes checked |

## Team Agreements

- Peer convention research continues as standard practice for config/tooling features
- Forward-carry pattern between stories continues — each story documents learnings for the next
- Retro action items should be implemented inline with the retro commit when possible

## Readiness Assessment

- Testing & Quality: 762 tests, all quality gates green, zero regressions
- Deployment: All changes merged to main
- Stakeholder Acceptance: Confirmed by Alberto-Codes (validated by 6 subsequent epics)
- Technical Health: Codebase stable, zero debug sessions, zero new tech debt
- Unresolved Blockers: None

**Verdict:** Epic 16 fully complete. Additive Exclude Configuration delivered — developers can use `extend-exclude` to append patterns to defaults following the ruff/black/flake8 convention. Validated by 6 subsequent epics (17–22) with zero regressions.
