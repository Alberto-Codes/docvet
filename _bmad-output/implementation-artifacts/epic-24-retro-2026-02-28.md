## Successes

- **Zero-debug streak: 11 consecutive stories** (Epics 22-24) — spec quality with exact external API signatures continues to be the #1 velocity lever
- **Conscious FR deviation backed by ecosystem research** — FR138 severity mapping changed from Error/Information to Warning/Hint based on LSP ecosystem analysis (ruff, pyright, pylsp); docstring findings are quality warnings, not broken code
- **Primary research on 34 Claude Code plugins** informed keyword selection, README structure, and `maxRestarts` configuration for Story 24.2
- **Code review caught real issues in both stories** — H1 (test reimplemented handler logic instead of calling it), M2 (module-level global coupling), 6 config/README gaps in 24.2
- **3/3 action items from Epic 23 retro applied** — spec quality maintained, story sequencing correct (LSP first, plugin second), forward intelligence referenced in 24.2 dev notes
- **Story 25-3 completed** — docs-site enforcement in story creation DoD, addressing the longest-carried retro action item (from Epic 22)

---

## Challenges

- **Docs site updates deferred in both stories** — both 24.1 and 24.2 noted editor integration page as deferred; LSP server shipped but docs site has no page explaining VS Code/Neovim/Helix configuration
- **Config-only stories still need rigorous review** — Story 24.2 had 6 review findings on JSON config and a README; "no code changes" does not mean "no review needed"
- **Small epic (2 stories) limits velocity analysis** — hard to draw broad conclusions from a 2-story sample

---

## Key Insights

1. **Exact external API specs in story dev notes eliminate debugging** — pygls v2 import paths, method signatures, and version-specific behavior were documented precisely in 24.1's dev notes; zero guesswork, zero debug
2. **Ecosystem research before design deviations produces better outcomes** — analyzing how ruff, pyright, and pylsp handle severity mapping led to a better UX decision than the original FR spec
3. **Tests that reimplement logic instead of calling real handlers create false confidence** — H1 in 24.1 caught a test that passed but didn't verify the actual `did_save` fallback behavior
4. **Config/docs stories benefit from adversarial review** — 24.2's 6 findings prove that README structure, keywords, and missing sections are real quality concerns
5. **Deferred docs are acceptable when tracked** — both stories documented the gap in Documentation Impact, and Story 26-2 (editor integration page) exists in the backlog

## Previous Retro Follow-Through (Epic 23)

| # | Action Item | Status |
|---|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Maintain spec quality as the zero-debug lever | Applied — both 24.1 and 24.2 zero-debug; pygls v2 spec was the key enabler |
| 2 | Story sequencing as velocity lever | Applied — LSP server first, plugin second (correct dependency order) |
| 3 | Forward intelligence as standard practice | Applied — 24.2 dev notes explicitly reference 24.1 learnings |

**Formal action items completed: 3/3**

**Carried Forward from Epic 22 (status update):**
- Enforce docs-site updates in DoD → Story 25-3: **Done** (completed 2026-02-28)
- Add docs-impact check to code review → Story 25-4: Backlog
- Investigate CI docs freshness check → Story 25-5: Backlog
- Explore diagrams-as-code → Story 26-3: Backlog

**Follow-through trend:** `4/4 → 2/4 → 1/4 → 3/3 → 3/3 → 3/3 → 3/3 → 4/6 → 7/8 → 2/2 → 0/2 → 0/1 → 2/4 → 2/2 → N/A → N/A → N/A → N/A → 3/3 → 3/3 → 3/3`

## Action Items

### Process Improvements

1. **Spec quality with exact external API signatures**
   - Owner: Bob (SM) / Alice (PO)
   - Success criteria: Any story integrating an external library includes exact import paths, method signatures, and version-specific behavior in dev notes

2. **Ecosystem research before design deviations**
   - Owner: All devs
   - Success criteria: When deviating from a spec, document the research that justifies it with specific comparisons

3. **Tests must exercise real code paths, not reimplement logic**
   - Owner: All devs + reviewers
   - Success criteria: Code reviews explicitly check that tests call the actual function/handler, not a manual reimplementation of its logic

### Technical Debt

None new. Epic 24 shipped clean.

### Carried Forward

- Editor integration docs page → Story 26-2 (backlog)
- Docs-impact check in code review → Story 25-4 (backlog)
- CI docs freshness check → Story 25-5 (backlog)
- Explore diagrams-as-code → Story 26-3 (backlog)

### Team Agreements

- Exact external API specs drive zero-debug — when integrating a library, document exact signatures, not vague descriptions
- Config/docs stories get the same adversarial review rigor as code stories
- Deferred docs are acceptable if tracked — capture them in Documentation Impact and verify a backlog item exists

---

## Readiness Assessment

- Testing & Quality: All green, 971 tests passing, zero docvet findings
- Deployment: Shipped — LSP server via `pip install docvet[lsp]`, plugin via `claude plugin install github:Alberto-Codes/docvet`
- Stakeholder Acceptance: Complete — Epic 25 already in-progress
- Technical Health: Stable, zero concerns
- Unresolved Blockers: None

---

## Next Steps

1. Epic 25 already in-progress — continue with remaining stories (25-4, 25-5)
2. Review action items in next standup
3. Editor integration docs page tracked in Story 26-2 backlog
