**Agent Models Used:**

- Stories 14.1–14.5: Claude Opus 4.6

## Successes & Strengths

1. **Single-day delivery — fastest epic in project history.** All 5 stories completed on 2026-02-24 with zero regressions. Config/docs-only epics execute extremely fast when the codebase is stable from prior quality investments.
2. **Root cause diagnosis of changelog duplication (Story 14.1).** Traced duplicate entries to merge commits preserving both branch histories. Found release-please maintainers explicitly confirming this in issue #2476. Fix: switch develop-to-main from merge commit to rebase-and-merge. Foundational — all subsequent stories built on this pipeline fix.
3. **Coherent adoption arc.** Pipeline fix (14.1) → marketplace prep (14.2) → CI dogfood (14.3) → integration docs (14.4) → badge branding (14.5). Each story lowered one more barrier between "heard about docvet" and "enforcing it in CI."
4. **Previous story intelligence pattern.** Each story documented learnings from the prior story: CHANGELOG conflict warnings, commit style preferences, docs dependency requirements, CI verification patterns. Forward-carry prevented rework.
5. **Lowest review actionable rate in project history.** 2/15 findings required fixes (13%). Design decisions were documented with options analysis (merge strategy, README restructuring, fail-on scope), leaving little room for review disagreement.
6. **Party mode produced solid epic design.** The 2026-02-24 party mode session generated branding decisions (`shield`/`purple`), story ordering rationale, and the "fix pipeline first" strategy.
7. **Maximum dogfood credibility (Story 14.3).** Chose all 4 checks in `fail-on` with `fetch-depth: 0` for full clone. Strongest possible signal — docvet eats its own cooking at full strength.

## Challenges & Growth Areas

1. **Maintainer tasks deferred — incomplete AC verification.** Stories 14.1, 14.2, and 14.3 all have unchecked Task 4 items requiring maintainer actions (develop-to-main merge, marketplace publish, CI verification). Stories were marked "done" before all ACs were verified. **Process change agreed:** "done" means ALL ACs verified, including maintainer steps.
2. **Retro action item follow-through at 0% again.** Epic 13's single action item (CC ≤ 12 in sonarqube.md) was not addressed during Epic 14. Third consecutive retro flagging documentation carry-forwards. **Process change agreed:** add enforcement mechanism to surface retro items at epic start.
3. **MEMORY.md updates still not happening at epic completion.** Team agreement from Epic 13 retro ("MEMORY.md updates as part of definition of done") was not followed. MEMORY.md fell further behind.

## Key Insights & Learnings

1. **Config/docs-only epics execute extremely fast on a stable codebase.** When prior epics invest in code quality, dogfooding, and refactoring, adoption-focused work has zero friction. Single-day delivery validates the compounding investment thesis.
2. **Story ordering matters for pipeline dependencies.** Fixing the release pipeline first (14.1) enabled all subsequent stories to flow through it with confidence. The epic spec's ordering rationale was sound.
3. **"Done" should mean fully verified, not dev-complete.** Marking stories "done" with unverified maintainer-dependent ACs creates a false completion signal. Need a status that distinguishes dev-complete from fully-verified.
4. **Documentation carry-forwards need enforcement, not agreements.** Three consecutive retros have flagged the same pattern. Agreements alone don't work for low-priority documentation items — need a mechanism that surfaces them at the right moment.
5. **Forward-carry of learnings between stories is a proven accelerator.** The "previous story intelligence" section in dev notes prevented each story from rediscovering gotchas (CHANGELOG conflicts, commit preferences, dependency requirements).

## Previous Retro Follow-Through

**Epic 13 Action Items:**

| # | Action | Status | Evidence |
|---|--------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Add CC ≤ 12 snippet analyzer target to `.claude/rules/sonarqube.md` | ❌ Not Addressed | sonarqube.md contains no mention of CC ≤ 12 target |

**Epic 13 Team Agreements:**

| Agreement | Applied? | Evidence |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Plugin research must include integration spike | N/A | No third-party plugin integration in Epic 14 |
| Story pivot → full scrub before review | N/A | No story pivots in Epic 14 |
| MEMORY.md updates at epic completion | ❌ | MEMORY.md still reflects outdated state |

**Score: 0/1 completed**

**Trend: 4/4 → 2/4 → 1/4 → 3/3 → 3/3 → 3/3 → 3/3 → 4/6 → 7/8 → 2/2 → 0/2 → 0/1**

**Analysis:** Second consecutive 0% follow-through on documentation carry-forwards. Team agreement from Epic 13 ("make memory updates part of definition of done") was not followed. Root cause: no enforcement mechanism — agreements made in retros don't get surfaced when epic work begins. Process change: add retro action item surfacing to create-story workflow.

## Technical Debt

No new technical debt incurred in Epic 14. Carried forward:

| Category | Count | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| CC ≤ 12 in sonarqube.md | 1 | Outstanding since Epic 12 (third retro flagging) |
| MEMORY.md staleness | 1 | Chronic — team agreement to fix not followed |

## Action Items

| # | Action | Owner | Priority | Success Criteria |
|---|--------|-------|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | Add CC ≤ 12 snippet analyzer target to `.claude/rules/sonarqube.md` | Charlie (Senior Dev) | LOW | sonarqube.md explicitly states "target CC ≤ 12 with `analyze_code_snippet`" |
| 2 | Update story workflow: "done" requires all ACs verified including maintainer steps | Bob (Scrum Master) | MEDIUM | Sprint-status definitions updated; stories with maintainer-dependent ACs tracked to full verification |
| 3 | Add retro action item surfacing to create-story workflow | Bob (Scrum Master) | MEDIUM | When creating Story X.1, workflow checks most recent retro for outstanding items |
| 4 | Update MEMORY.md with Epic 14+ completion state | Alberto-Codes | LOW | MEMORY.md reflects current project state (21 epics done, backlog, branch migration) |

## Team Agreements

- "Done" means ALL acceptance criteria verified, including maintainer-dependent steps
- Retro action items get surfaced at the start of each new epic (enforcement, not just agreement)
- Previous story intelligence pattern continues — each story documents learnings for the next

## Readiness Assessment

- Testing & Quality: ✅ 743 tests, all quality gates green, zero regressions
- Deployment: ⚠️ Maintainer steps partially pending (marketplace publish, develop→main merges)
- Stakeholder Acceptance: ✅ Confirmed by Alberto-Codes
- Technical Health: ✅ Codebase stable, zero debug sessions, zero new tech debt
- Unresolved Blockers: None

**Verdict:** Epic 14 fully complete from a story perspective. Adoption & Integration delivered — release pipeline fixed, marketplace-ready branding, CI dogfood job live, integration docs published, badge branding unified. First all-config/docs epic delivered in a single day, validating the compounding quality investment across 13 prior epics.

## Project-Wide Summary (Epics 1-14)

| Epic | Focus | Stories | Status |
|------|-------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Function-Level Enrichment | 7 | Done |
| 2 | Class & Module Enrichment | 2 | Done |
| 3 | Format & Recommended Rules | 2 | Done |
| 4 | Freshness Diff Mode | 3 | Done |
| 5 | Freshness Drift Mode | 3 | Done |
| 6 | Coverage Check | 2 | Done |
