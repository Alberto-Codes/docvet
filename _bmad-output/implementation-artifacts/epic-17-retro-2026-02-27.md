# Retrospective: Epic 17 — Publish Reliability

**Date:** 2026-02-27
**Facilitator:** Bob (Scrum Master)
**Epic:** Epic 17 — Publish Reliability
**Status:** Complete (1/1 stories done)

## Team Participants

- Bob (Scrum Master) — Facilitator
- Alice (Product Owner)
- Charlie (Senior Dev / Architect)
- Dana (QA Engineer)
- Elena (Junior Dev)
- Alberto-Codes (Project Lead)

## Epic Summary & Metrics

**Delivery:**

- Stories completed: 1/1 (100%)
- PR: #134 — `feat(ci): add post-publish PyPI smoke test`
- Files modified: `.github/workflows/publish.yml` (+25 lines)
- Zero source code changes — CI-only epic
- FRs completed: FR1, FR2
- NFRs satisfied: NFR1, NFR2

**Quality:**

- Debug sessions required: 0 (14th consecutive zero-debug epic)
- Blockers encountered: 0
- Technical debt incurred: 0 new items
- Regressions: 0
- Quality gates: 6/6 green (762 tests passing)
- Code review: Approved with minor fix (1 MEDIUM finding fixed, 2 LOW rejected)

**Agent Models Used:**

- Story 17.1: Claude Opus 4.6

## Successes & Strengths

1. **Automated release trust.** Before this epic, every PyPI release required manual verification. Now the publish workflow automatically installs from PyPI and verifies `docvet --version` and `docvet check --help` exit successfully.
2. **Simplicity over engineering.** `sleep 60` for PyPI CDN propagation instead of retry-with-backoff loops. Dev Notes prescribed the simple approach and it was followed.
3. **Epic 10 CI lessons continued to pay off.** No permissions issues, no OIDC confusion — hard-won lessons from CLAUDE.md applied without friction.
4. **Healthy code review pushback.** Three LOW findings rejected with clear rationale (pip vs python -m pip, needs: syntax consistency, timeout-minutes traceability). One MEDIUM finding fixed (stale line numbers in AC-to-Test table).
5. **Proactive safeguard.** `timeout-minutes: 5` added beyond original task scope to prevent runaway billing — good defensive practice.

## Challenges & Growth Areas

1. **No notable challenges.** Clean single-story CI-only epic with zero friction. The only minor issue was AC-to-Test line references going stale after the `timeout-minutes` addition — a recurring pattern with line-number-based traceability in YAML-only stories.

## Key Insights & Learnings

1. **CI-only stories verify by YAML inspection, not pytest.** When the deliverable is a workflow file with no source code changes, AC-to-Test traceability maps to line-number references in the YAML. This is appropriate but fragile to late additions.
2. **Boring epics are healthy epics.** When a well-scoped single-story epic executes cleanly with zero friction, it signals the process and patterns are mature.
3. **Forward-carry from CI lessons.** Dev Notes referenced Epic 10's CLAUDE.md CI/CD lessons directly, preventing rediscovery of permissions and OIDC gotchas.

## Previous Retro Follow-Through

**Epic 16 Action Items:**

No action items were set in Epic 16's retrospective. Clean slate.

**Trend: 4/4 → 2/4 → 1/4 → 3/3 → 3/3 → 3/3 → 3/3 → 4/6 → 7/8 → 2/2 → 0/2 → 0/1 → 2/4 → 2/2 → N/A**

**Analysis:** Epic 16 had no action items, so no follow-through to evaluate.

## Technical Debt

No new technical debt incurred in Epic 17. No carried items remaining.

## Action Items

None. Epic was clean, no process changes needed.

## Readiness Assessment

- Testing & Quality: All 762 tests green, all quality gates passing, zero regressions
- Deployment: PR #134 merged to main, smoke test active in publish workflow
- Stakeholder Acceptance: Confirmed by Alberto-Codes
- Technical Health: Codebase stable, zero debug sessions, zero new tech debt
- Unresolved Blockers: None

**Verdict:** Epic 17 fully complete. Post-publish PyPI smoke test is live — every future release is automatically verified after PyPI publication. No dependencies or blockers for Epic 18.
