## Successes

- **Docs-enforcement gates validated** — The two-gate system from Epic 25 (25.3 create-story gate, 25.4 code-review check) worked as designed on its first real epic. All docs-producing stories had Documentation Impact sections filled at creation time, and code review checked for docs accuracy. This validates a process investment that originated in Epic 22.
- **Mermaid infrastructure as a one-time unlock** — Story 26.3's `custom_fences` config change enables Mermaid diagrams on any future docs page with zero additional setup. A small infrastructure investment that compounds.
- **Code review on docs-only stories catches real issues** — ~16 findings across 4 stories. The dominant theme was *accuracy of prose claims* (e.g., "zero configuration" when there's a prereq, "runs the same checks" when freshness is excluded). These are genuine user-facing quality issues.
- **Spike pattern proven and repeatable** — Story 26.4 followed the 25.5 spike template: evidence-based research, 4 PoC runs, structured comparison, courage to recommend "defer" when the investment isn't justified. Raw PoC output preserved for independent verification.
- **Multi-layer review effectiveness** — On 26.4, adversarial review + party mode caught 3 findings, then Copilot PR review caught 4 additional count inconsistencies. Different review approaches catch different issue categories.
- **Zero-debug streak continues** — 20+ consecutive stories across Epics 22-26 with zero debug sessions

## Challenges

- **Second consecutive docs-only epic** — No new Python runtime code, no new tests, test count unchanged at 971. While docs are valuable, two consecutive non-code epics creates desire to return to feature/fix work.
- **Accuracy in prose claims** — Recurring review finding in 3 of 4 stories: imprecise technical language becoming inaccurate user-facing claims. "Zero configuration," "runs the same checks," "full list of rules," module count discrepancies — all caught in review but repeatedly.
- **`mkdocs build --strict` doesn't validate Mermaid syntax** — A broken Mermaid diagram passes the strict build but renders as an error box in the browser. Manual browser verification was needed for 26.3.
- **Module count reconciliation required multiple passes** — Story 26.4's analysis had "9 source modules" in one place, "12 nodes" in another; actual count was 10-13 depending on inclusion criteria. Required adversarial review + PR review to fully reconcile.

## Key Insights

1. **Prose accuracy is a genuine quality dimension** — Imprecise technical claims in documentation create user confusion. Code review is the right gate to catch them, and the pattern appeared in 75% of stories.
2. **Auto-generated diagrams complement, don't replace, manual diagrams** — Structural snapshots (import graphs, class hierarchies) and architecture overviews (data flow, entry points) serve different purposes. The manual diagram from 26.3 remains the right abstraction.
3. **Infrastructure investments compound** — Mermaid config (26.3), docs-enforcement gates (25.3/25.4), spike template (25.5/26.4) — each small investment reduces friction for all future work.
4. **Multi-layer review catches more** — Adversarial review + party mode consensus + Copilot PR review each caught unique issue categories. The combination provides broader coverage than any single approach.

## Previous Retro Follow-Through (Epic 25)

| # | Action Item | Status |
|---|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Validate docs-enforcement gates on first real epic | ✅ Completed — all 3 docs-producing stories used the 25.3 create-story gate and 25.4 code-review check correctly |
| 2 | Maintain decision documentation pattern for config stories | N/A — no config/CI stories in Epic 26 |

**Applicable action items completed: 1/1** (1 not applicable due to epic nature)

**Carried Forward from Epic 25 (final status):**

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| CLAUDE.md stale test structure → backlog chore | Still backlog |
| `test_exports.py` missing `docvet.lsp` → backlog chore | Still backlog |
| Editor integration docs page → Story 26-2 | **Done** |
| Explore diagrams-as-code → Story 26-3/26-4 | **Done** |

**Follow-through trend:** `4/4 → 2/4 → 1/4 → 3/3 → 3/3 → 3/3 → 3/3 → 4/6 → 7/8 → 2/2 → 0/2 → 0/1 → 2/4 → 2/2 → N/A → N/A → N/A → N/A → 3/3 → 3/3 → 3/3 → 1/1 → 1/1`

## Action Items

### Process Improvements

1. **Precision language review pass for docs-only stories**
   - Owner: All devs (self-review before code review)
   - Success criteria: Before submitting docs-only stories for code review, do a self-review pass specifically targeting claim accuracy — verify every technical assertion (counts, features, capabilities) against source code
   - Evidence: 3/4 stories in Epic 26 had prose accuracy findings caught only in review

2. **Mermaid browser verification as standard gate for diagram stories**
   - Owner: Bob (SM) — add to story template when Mermaid diagrams are involved
   - Success criteria: Any story creating/modifying Mermaid diagrams includes a task for manual browser verification (dark + light mode), since `mkdocs build --strict` doesn't validate Mermaid syntax

### Technical Debt

None new. Epic 26 shipped clean.

**Still carried forward:**
- CLAUDE.md stale test structure section (from 25.1 review)
- `test_exports.py` missing `docvet.lsp` module (from 25.1 review)

### Team Agreements

- Prose accuracy is a quality dimension equal to code accuracy — imprecise technical claims in docs are defects
- Multi-layer review (adversarial + party mode + Copilot) provides the broadest issue coverage — continue using all layers on non-trivial stories
- Spike template (25.5 → 26.4) is the standard for research stories — evidence first, recommendation with rationale, raw output preserved

---

## Readiness Assessment

- Testing & Quality: All green, 971 tests passing, zero docvet findings
- Deployment: N/A — no new runtime code to deploy
- Stakeholder Acceptance: N/A — documentation completeness epic
- Technical Health: Stable, zero concerns
- Unresolved Blockers: None

## Next Steps

1. Begin Epic 27 (Freshness Accuracy) — no prep sprint needed
2. Story 27.1 is the only story — fix hunk-to-symbol false positives in freshness diff mode
3. First code-changing epic since Epic 24 — modifies `checks/freshness.py`
4. Review action items in next standup
