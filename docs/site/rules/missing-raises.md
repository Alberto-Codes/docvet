# `missing-raises`

{{ rule_header() }}

## What it detects

This rule flags functions and methods that contain `raise` statements in their body but have no `Raises:` section in their docstring.

## Why is this a problem?

Callers of the function don't know which exceptions to expect. Without a documented `Raises:` section, downstream code can't write correct `try`/`except` blocks, leading to unhandled exceptions in production. API documentation generated by mkdocstrings will also lack exception information.

## Example

=== "Violation"

    ```python
    def parse_config(path: str) -> dict:
        """Parse a TOML configuration file.

        Args:
            path: Path to the config file.

        Returns:
            Parsed configuration dictionary.
        """
        if not path.endswith(".toml"):
            raise ValueError(f"Expected .toml file, got: {path}")
        with open(path) as f:
            return toml.load(f)
    ```

=== "Fix"

    ```python hl_lines="10 11"
    def parse_config(path: str) -> dict:
        """Parse a TOML configuration file.

        Args:
            path: Path to the config file.

        Returns:
            Parsed configuration dictionary.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If the file does not have a .toml extension.
        """
        if not path.endswith(".toml"):
            raise ValueError(f"Expected .toml file, got: {path}")
        with open(path) as f:
            return toml.load(f)
    ```
