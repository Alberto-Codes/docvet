# `missing-yields`

{{ rule_header() }}

## What it detects

This rule flags generator functions that contain `yield` or `yield from` statements but have no `Yields:` section in their docstring.

## Why is this a problem?

Consumers of the generator don't know what values it produces. Without a `Yields:` section, callers must read the source code to understand the iteration contract. API documentation generated by mkdocstrings will also lack yield information, making the generator's interface opaque.

## Example

=== "Violation"

    ```python
    def stream_results(query: str) -> Iterator[dict]:
        """Stream database results for a query.

        Args:
            query: SQL query string.
        """
        for row in db.execute(query):
            yield dict(row)
    ```

=== "Fix"

    ```python hl_lines="7 8"
    def stream_results(query: str) -> Iterator[dict]:
        """Stream database results for a query.

        Args:
            query: SQL query string.

        Yields:
            Row data as a dictionary with column names as keys.
        """
        for row in db.execute(query):
            yield dict(row)
    ```
